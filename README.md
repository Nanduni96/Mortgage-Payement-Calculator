# Mortgage-Payement-Calculator
Mortgage payments can be easily found using your chosen spreadsheet program. This function, in all major spreadsheet programs (Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet, and Apple Numbers), is known as PMT, or the payment function.
It combines information like your interest rate, number of periods, and principal to arrive at an amount for each monthly payment.

- In order to calculate the monthly payment, we can rely on a relatively simple equation. The monthly payment equation can be represented as follows: 
- M=P{{r(1+r)^{{n}}} / {(1+r)^{{n}}-1}}. 

- These variables represent the following inputs:
- M is your monthly payment.
- P is your principal.
- r is your monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 12.
- n is your number of payments (the number of months you will be paying the loan)
